## 10. Interpretation. 

If any provision of this EULA requires judicial interpretation, this Agreement is not to be more strictly construed against one party than the other.

This EULA may be executed by electronic transmission (i.e., facsimile or electronically transmitted portable document format (PDF) or Docusign or similar E-Sign compliant electronic signature) and in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original with the same effect as if the signatures thereto were on the same instrument.

## 12. Entire Agreement.
