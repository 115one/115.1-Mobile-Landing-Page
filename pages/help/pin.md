## PIN

Your 115.1 Messenger PIN is a code used to support features like non-phone number based identifiers. This means that your PIN can recover your profile, settings, contacts, and who youâ€™ve blocked if you ever lose or switch devices. A PIN can also serve as an optional registration lock to prevent others from registering your number on your behalf.

To enable this, 115.1 Messenger uses Secure Value Recovery which keeps your social graph unknown to our servers. This is unlike other apps and platforms that store this kind of data in plaintext on their servers.

#### Important:

* A PIN is not a chat backup. Your message history is not linked to a PIN and a PIN cannot be used to recover lost chat history.
* We do not know your PIN and cannot reset or recover it for you.
* If you forget the PIN and have enabled a registration lock, you may be locked out of your account for up to 7 days.
