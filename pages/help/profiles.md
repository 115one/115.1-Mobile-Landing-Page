## Profiles and Message Requests

![Message request](/assets/screens/Message%20Requests-small.png)

115.1 Messenger Profiles and Message Requests let people know who's messaging them.

 

### What is my 115.1 Messenger Profile?

Your encrypted 115.1 Messenger Profile is a name and picture that you set up within the app. If you lose or switch devices, your existing profile can be recovered using your PIN.

### Is a 115.1 Messenger Profile required? 

Mandatory (encrypted) names let people know who's messaging them.

* First names are required. Feel free to choose a nickname, a single character, or an emoji.
* Photos and last names are optional.
* Keep in mind, this is what people will see when you message them if they don't have you saved to their contacts.
* Profile names are required to support message requests and new upcoming features like automatic group upgrades.

### How is my 115.1 Messenger Profile displayed?

It will be shown alongside your existing phone number when communicating with other users. Conversations will feel more personal. Group threads will be less confusing.

### Who can see my 115.1 Messenger Profile?

It is automatically shared with 

* any contacts you have saved in your address book,
* any people or groups in conversations you create,
* any people or groups you explicitly accept,
* and any groups you are added to by someone that you had previously shared your profile with.

### Is sharing my 115.1 Messenger Profile required?

Yes, it is required to share your profile to continue conversations with any un-saved contacts to support new upcoming features like automatic group migration.

### Can 115.1 Messenger's servers see my 115.1 Messenger Profile?

The 115.1 Messenger service does not have any knowledge of the name you have chosen or the image you have set. Your profile information is end-to-end encrypted with a unique profile key that is securely shared via the same 115.1 Messenger Protocol messaging channel that already protects your conversations and calls.

### What is a Message Request?

![Message request](/assets/screens/Footer%20-%20Light.png)

Message Requests give you the option to block, delete, or accept messages from somebody who is trying to get in touch with you.

* To support message requests, you'll now need to create a 115.1 Messenger profile.
* For individual conversations, you get to see the name (and photo) of the person who's trying to message you.
* For group conversations, you have better control whether you join a group or not and the group members will be less confusing with profiles instead of a bunch of phone numbers.
