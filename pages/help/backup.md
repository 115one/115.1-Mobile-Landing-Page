### I need some more help.
* Make sure you moved the backup file to your new phone, or moved it onto your phone that was reset.
* Some devices may need to power down and restart to see the backup file.
* Make sure the backup file is visible. As a reminder, backup filenames follow this format: 115.1 Messenger-year-month-date-time.backup
* Enable all the permissions for 115.1 Messenger.
    * The media permission is required in order to locate backup files on your device storage. 
* Here's another way to make sure your backup file is in the correct spot on your new phone. 
    1. On your new phone, register for 115.1 Messenger without a backup (your old phone will now go offline).
    2. Enable a backup on your new phone.
    3. Find the new backup on your new phone and write down where it is. Look at the file name to confirm you just made this backup.
    4. Uninstall 115.1 Messenger on the new phone.
    5. Carefully find your old backup. Look at the date and time in the file name. 
    6. Move the old backup to the same folder you found in step 3.
    7. Install 115.1 Messenger.
