If you do not agree with our policies and practices, do not download, register with, or use this App. By downloading, registering with, or using this App, you agree to this privacy policy.

<h1 id="2-children-under-the-age-of-13">2. Children Under the Age of 13</h1>

<h4 id="additional-information-for-european-users-1">Additional information for European users</h4>

<p>In addition, we may limit how we collect, use and store some of the information of European Users between 13 and 16.
