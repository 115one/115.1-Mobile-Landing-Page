<h2 id="12-entire-agreement">12. Entire Agreement.</h2>

<p>This EULA constitutes the entire agreement between the parties on the subject hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, negotiations, representations and proposals, written or oral. By executing this EULA, Licensee acknowledges that it has reviewed this EULA and shall be legally bound by the same. Each party represents and warrants that it has obtained any and all necessary corporate authorizations to enter into this Agreement and that it is executed by a person with the authority to legally bind the party.</p>
